## Project Description

A travel app include a simple form where you enter the location you are traveling to and the date you are leaving. If the trip is within a week, you will get the current weather forecast. If the trip is in the future, you will get a predicted forecast.

# Project Instructions

The goal of this project is to give me practice with:
- Setting up Webpack
- Sass styles
- Webpack Loaders and Plugins
- Creating layouts and page design
- Service workers
- Using APIs and creating requests to external urls

Remember that once you clone, you will still need to install everything:

`cd` into your new folder and run:
- `npm install`
